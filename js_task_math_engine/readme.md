* Given an array of integers.

* Return a number that is the sum of

The product of all the non-negative numbers
The sum of all the negative numbers

### Edge cases ###

* If there are no non-negative numbers, assume the product of them to be 1.
* Similarly, if there are no negative numbers, assume the sum of them to be 0.
* If the array is null, result should be 0.

### For example: ###

    mathEngine([1, 2, 3, -4, -5]) // should return -3
